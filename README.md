# Open-Tree-GUI

## Description

A simple GUI system utilizing layering and combining components, built on top of SFML

## Dependencies

This software requires the SFML dynamic library to be installed

It also uses code from the [tinyxml-2 repo](https://github.com/leethomason/tinyxml2/blob/master/tinyxml2.h). There was not an easy way to add this two my project, so the two source files, mostly unedited, have been added into the src/ and inc/ directories.

## Building

Build everything with `make`
